# Disco Trashbin — Planning and Electronics Design
**Author:** Nick  
**Time spent:** 5.5 hours

## Intention
Plan the Arduino system, sensors, motor control, and audio.

## What I built
- Sketched layout for two ultrasonic sensors, relay motor control, and the Adafruit Audio Shield.
- Breadboarded the audio shield and tested SD playback.
- Planned serial messages for syncing with Nasi’s ESP32.

## Decisions
- Use two sensors for wider detection.
- Shared ground across all boards.

## Issues and fixes
- SD card not detected. Reformatted and set correct CS pin.

# Disco Trashbin — Shelves, Panels, Internal Mounts
**Author:** Nick  
**Time spent:** 5.75 hours

## Intention
Create internal structure for electronics and wiring.

## What I built
- Installed shelves and chute behind the slot.
- Marked mounting points for boards and speakers.
- Drilled pass-through holes for LED and sensor cables.

## Decisions

# Disco Trashbin — Arduino Sensors, Motor, Audio
**Author:** Nick  
**Time spent:** 8.0 hours

## Intention
Program the Arduino for detection, motor control, and sound.

## What I built
- Wrote sensor code with filtering and entry detection.
- Added relay motor control with PWM speed ramp.
- Integrated the audio shield to play sounds.
- Added START_SHOW and END_SHOW serial messages.

## Decisions
- Entry threshold tuned to avoid false triggers.
- Added cooldown timer.

## Issues and fixes
- Sensor spikes at startup fixed with boot delay.

## Source Code
Here is the [Source Code](https://github.com/Nickdev8/trashbin/blob/main/trashbin.ino) running on the ardiuno

# Disco Trashbin — Soldering and Power Distribution
**Author:** Nick  
**Time spent:** 7.5 hours

## Intention
Permanently wire the electronics.

## What I built
- Soldered sensor leads and connectors.
- Made fused 5 V and 12 V power lines.
- Crimped motor and relay connections.
- Labeled and heat-shrank everything.

## Decisions
- Inline fuse holders for quick replacement.
- Zip-tie anchors for cable routing.

## Issues and fixes
- Short on audio ground fixed by redoing a wire.
